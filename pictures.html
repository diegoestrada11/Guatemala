                Antigua Guatemala, commonly referred to as Antigua, is a captivating city nestled 
                in the central highlands of Guatemala. Steeped in rich history, this UNESCO World 
                Heritage site exudes charm and cultural significance. Antigua was once the capital 
                of Guatemala until a series of devastating earthquakes led to its relocation to 
                present-day Guatemala City. Today, Antigua stands as a testament to its colonial 
                past, with its well-preserved Spanish Baroque-influenced architecture, cobbled 
                streets, and colorful facades. The city is renowned for its beautiful churches, 
                such as the iconic La Merced and the majestic Cathedral of Santiago, which showcase 
                exquisite architectural details and religious artifacts. Antigua is also famous 
                for its vibrant celebrations, particularly during Semana Santa (Holy Week), when 
                elaborate processions fill the streets with fervor and devotion. Visitors to 
                Antigua can explore its captivating plazas, browse through bustling markets 
                brimming with local crafts and textiles, and savor the flavors of traditional 
                Guatemalan cuisine. With its enchanting ambiance, historical significance, and 
                natural beauty, Antigua Guatemala continues to captivate the hearts of both locals 
                and travelers alike.
