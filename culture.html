                    Guatemala is known for its rich indigenous heritage, with over 20 distinct indigenous groups that have 
                    preserved their customs and traditions for centuries. Each group has its own unique language, clothing, 
                    and rituals, adding to the country's cultural diversity. The Mayan influence is particularly prominent, 
                    with ancient ruins and archaeological sites serving as reminders of Guatemala's pre-Columbian past.

                    Guatemala, a Central American country south of Mexico, is home to volcanoes, rainforests and ancient 
                    Mayan sites. The capital, Guatemala City, features the stately National Palace of Culture and the National 
                    Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Antigua, west of the capital, contains preserved Spanish colonial 
                    buildings.

                    Traditional Arts and Crafts: Guatemalan artisans are renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship and the 
                    vibrant colors of their textiles. Handwoven fabrics, such as the intricate Mayan huipils (traditional blouses) 
                    and cortes (wraparound skirts), showcase a mastery of traditional techniques passed down through generations. 
                    Pottery, woodcarving, and silverwork are also highly valued forms of artistic expression in Guatemala.
